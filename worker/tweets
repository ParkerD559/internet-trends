all those games Have Guns but guns aren't a central part of gameplay like how it is in doom so it's not a fair thing to say at all, there's hardly ever a moment where you're not using a gun in doom and mainly basing his moveset on doom '16 and glory kills would be super lame

Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......

@MarkFabian21 @SilERabbit A basic income is a permanent strike fund for everyone. It means that employers have to actually offer you something worthwhile to come work for them instead of threatening you with starvation. It gives you an actual BATNA.
